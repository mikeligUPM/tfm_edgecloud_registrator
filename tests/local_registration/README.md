The purpose of the code within this folder is to be able to do a registration using the Geotransformer model with own data or with the 3dmatch 'Redkitchen' scene data. The data is not included in this folder.

In order to run this code, a folder called "results" needs to be created in the root directory of this code, so that the registration results are saved there.
